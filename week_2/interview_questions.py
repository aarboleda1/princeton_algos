Permutation. Given two integer arrays of size nn, design a subquadratic

That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly,
in a different order.

"""
Dutch national flag. Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red,
white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

swap(i, j)swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket ii with the pebble in bucket jj.
color(i)color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucket ii.
The performance requirements are as follows:

At most nn calls to color()color().
At most nn calls to swap()swap().
Constant extra space.
