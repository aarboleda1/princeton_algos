"""A Binary Search tree that uses points in as nodes

- Useful for geometric applications
- Each node will be partitioned vertially or horizontally
- Note: if a node is partitioned horizontally, then it's
two children will be partitioned vertically and vice versa
"""


"""Range search in a KD tree/Find all points a rectangle
- Check if a point in node lies in given rectangle
- Recursively search left/bottom (if any could fall in rectangle)
- Recursively search right/top (if any could fall in rectangle)
