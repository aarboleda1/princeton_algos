[ ] Linked List
[ ] Dynamic array, implemented with a ring buffer (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
[ ] Hash set
[ ] Hash map (with chaining)
[ ] Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that Fibonacci heaps exist and know their guarantees)
[ ] Binary search tree (doesn’t need to be self-balancing; know that self-balancing trees exist and know their guarantees)
[ ] Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
[ ] Suffix tree (don’t worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that Ukkonen’s algorithm exists and learn its guarantees)
[ ] An object-oriented adjacency list for graphs
