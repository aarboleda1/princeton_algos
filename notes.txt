System Architecture Study Guide and Notes

In-memory database

- In memory database relies on main memory for computer data storage. The contrast
to this is a database management system that uses disk storage for storage
-  In memory db's are faster than disk-optimized storage because disk access is slower
than memory access
- A cache miss is when data is fetched, but the request is not in the response.
Therefore, the request has to go to the disk storage layer to retrieve the data

11/12 Backtracking
- What is backtracking?
  A systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search
  space. These configurations may represent all possible arrangements of objects
  (or permutations)

  Other situations include ALL paths between 2 vertices, ALL possible ways to
  partition 2 vertices

- Backtracking ensures correctness by enumerating all possibilities.
It ensures efficiency by never visiting a state more than once.
