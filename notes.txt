System Architecture Study Guide and Notes

In-memory database

- In memory database relies on main memory for computer data storage. The contrast
to this is a database management system that uses disk storage for storage
-  In memory db's are faster than disk-optimized storage because disk access is slower
than memory access
- A cache miss is when data is fetched, but the request is not in the response.
Therefore, the request has to go to the disk storage layer to retrieve the data
